Dataset Information and Initial Setup
python
Copy code
import os
os.getcwd()
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("Heart.csv")
Get Current Working Directory: os.getcwd() helps ensure the dataset‚Äôs path is correct by showing where the script is running.
Load the Dataset: Using pd.read_csv("Heart.csv"), the heart disease dataset is loaded into a DataFrame, df, for easy manipulation and analysis.
Part A: Basic Data Exploration and Preparation
Shape of Data:

python
Copy code
df.shape
This command returns a tuple representing the dimensions of the dataset: (rows, columns).

Finding Missing Values:

python
Copy code
df.isnull()
df.isnull().sum()
df.isnull() returns a DataFrame of the same shape as df, with True for missing values.
df.isnull().sum() counts the number of missing values in each column. Handling missing data is essential to ensure accurate model training.
Data Types of Each Column:

python
Copy code
df.dtypes
This command shows the data type for each column, e.g., int64, float64, object. Knowing data types helps in identifying any transformations that might be needed, such as encoding categorical data.

Finding Zeros:

python
Copy code
df == 0
df[df == 0]
df[df == 0].count()
df == 0 returns a DataFrame of True values where the dataset has zeros.
df[df == 0].count() provides the count of zeros in each column, which can help identify columns where zero might indicate missing or placeholder values.
Mean Age of Patients:

python
Copy code
df["Age"].mean()
This calculates the mean age of the patients in the dataset, which can offer insights into the age distribution.

Part B: Selecting Specific Columns and Splitting Data
Extracting Columns:

python
Copy code
df[['Age', 'Sex', 'ChestPain', 'RestBP', 'Chol']]
newdf = df[['Age', 'Sex', 'ChestPain', 'RestBP', 'Chol']]
Here, only specific columns (Age, Sex, ChestPain, RestBP, Chol) are selected, creating a new DataFrame, newdf, for focused analysis.

Splitting Dataset into Train and Test Sets:

python
Copy code
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
train, test = train_test_split(df, random_state=0, test_size=0.25)
train_test_split divides df into train and test subsets.
random_state=0 ensures reproducibility of results.
test_size=0.25 allocates 25% of the data to testing and 75% to training, which is a typical split ratio.
Part C: Confusion Matrix and Classification Metrics for COVID Diagnosis Example
Defining Actual and Predicted Labels:

python
Copy code
import numpy as np 
actual = list(np.ones(45)) + list(np.zeros(55))
predicted = list(np.ones(40)) + list(np.zeros(52)) + list(np.ones(8))
actual represents the ground truth: 45 COVID-positive cases (1s) and 55 COVID-negative cases (0s).
predicted represents model predictions: it predicts 40 cases as positive, 52 as negative, and 8 incorrectly as positive.
Confusion Matrix Visualization:

python
Copy code
from sklearn.metrics import ConfusionMatrixDisplay
ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_predictions(actual, predicted)
This generates a confusion matrix to visualize the model's performance.
The confusion matrix displays counts for:
True Positives (TP): Correct positive predictions.
True Negatives (TN): Correct negative predictions.
False Positives (FP): Incorrect positive predictions.
False Negatives (FN): Incorrect negative predictions.
Classification Metrics:

python
Copy code
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
print(classification_report)
print(classification_report(actual, predicted))
The classification_report provides:

Accuracy: Proportion of correct predictions out of total samples.
Accuracy = TP+TN  / TP+TN+FP+FN

Precision: Proportion of true positives out of predicted positives.
Precision = ùëáùëÉ / ùëáùëÉ+ùêπùëÉ
 
Recall (Sensitivity): Proportion of true positives out of actual positives.
Recall = ùëáùëÉ / TP+FN
‚Äã 
F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics.
ùêπ1 = 2 √ó ((Precision √ó Recall) / (Precision + Recall))
 
These metrics help evaluate the model's performance, especially in scenarios with imbalanced datasets, where accuracy alone may be misleading.

Data preparation here includes:

Loading the dataset.
Checking shape, data types, and missing values.
Finding and counting zeros as potential placeholders.
Calculating the mean age.
Selecting key columns (Age, Sex, ChestPain, RestBP, Chol).
Splitting the data into training (75%) and testing (25%) sets.


Shape of the Dataset:
The shape tells us how many rows and columns the dataset has. It‚Äôs important for understanding dataset size and ensuring it‚Äôs suitable for analysis.

Handling Missing Values:
Missing values can cause issues in analysis and modeling, so we check for them to decide whether to remove, fill, or impute.

Knowing Data Types:
Data types (e.g., integer, float, string) tell us how data is stored. Knowing them helps ensure the data is correctly formatted for calculations.

Checking for Zeros:
Zeros might represent missing or default data. Identifying them helps decide if they need to be treated as missing values.

Calculating Mean Age:
The mean age gives a quick sense of the age distribution, which can help understand the dataset‚Äôs demographics.

Feature Selection:
Selecting Age, Sex, ChestPain, RestBP, and Chol focuses the analysis on the most relevant columns, simplifying the model and making it easier to interpret.

Data Splitting:
Splitting into training and testing sets allows the model to learn on one part of the data and be evaluated on unseen data to check its performance.

Confusion Matrix:
A confusion matrix shows counts of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, summarizing prediction results.

Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score:
Accuracy: Correct predictions out of all predictions.
Precision: True positives out of predicted positives.
Recall: True positives out of actual positives.
F1 Score: Balance between precision and recall, useful when classes are imbalanced.

Dealing with Imbalanced Classes:
In cases like COVID prediction with imbalanced data, precision and recall are more reliable than accuracy for assessing model performance.
Accuracy: It measures the proportion of all correct predictions (both positive and negative) out of all predictions. However, in imbalanced datasets (e.g., many negative cases, few positive cases), a model that predicts the majority class most of the time can still have high accuracy but perform poorly for the minority class (e.g., predicting COVID-positive cases).

Precision: It measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive cases (true positives) out of all predicted positive cases (true positives + false positives). In imbalanced data, this helps identify how well the model avoids falsely predicting COVID-positive when the person is not actually positive.

Recall: It measures the proportion of actual positive cases (true positives) that the model correctly predicted (true positives + false negatives). This is important because, in imbalanced data, we want to minimize the number of false negatives (i.e., missing actual COVID-positive cases).
